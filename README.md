combinatorial
=============

This package contains a collection of common non-deterministic and/or
combinatorial operations.  Many operations are intended to operate on
sets. The representation of these sets is not hidden; rather sets are
represented as lists.  Ideally, these lists contains no duplicate
elements and the order of their elements cannot be observed.  In
practice, these conditions are not enforced.
